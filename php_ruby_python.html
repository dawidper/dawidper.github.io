                <h1>Ruby vs PHP vs Python - simple microservice performance comparison</h1>
                <h4>For the last couple of years we observe slow but steady shift from building big "all-in-one" apps
                    (also known as Monoliths) towards distributed small architectures with separated responsibilities
                    (a.k.a. microservices).
                    As with any aspect of development there is a constant bragging about which of technologies are best
                    for those kind of apps. Today we are going to check how three most known and popular technologies
                    compare when it comes to straight performance.</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
                Lately I've migrated most of my infrastructure from dedicated/self-managed strong servers to Amazon
                Cloud Services (I changed strong multiprocessor servers with tones of RAM for small vm's and hosted
                services). Moving to instances so much slower than what i was used to
                forced me to split my Monolith-type app into many independently running services. <br/><br/>
                These days we do have many very similar languages or frameworks that are mirroring each other to provide
                very similar developing experience never mind the language or technology stack. <br/> Since they are so
                familiar when it comes to coding, can we just say that choice is only a matter of preference ?
                As we will learn in a moment very similar code can give extremely different results
                when it comes to performance. Since all the comparisons I was able to find based either on benchmarking
                framework bootstraping or heavy web applications like drupal/wordpress I found that they don't
                correspond to microservices. Additionally all ignored concurrent connections scaling aspect that is crucial to overall architecture cost. <br/>

                Since whole micro-framework approach is based on KISS principle I've decided to make this test simple yet
                meaningful with task as common as possible - retrieving, filtering and displaying list of results from
                database. <br/>
                I've created "users" table with 100 generated results that are being reused by all frameworks. All user
                emails have "gmail.com" added to them. <br/>
                For this test to lower the chance of any outside influence Sqlite3 will be used as db engine.

            Every stack is going to be tested for time serving 5000 requests with three different concurrency settings
            (1, 50 250 and 500 connections). For testing I am using idle server with following specs:
            <br/>
            CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 v2 <br/>
            RAM: 64GB <br/>
            All files including code and Sqlite DB file are stored on SSD drive. <br/>
            Benchmark is being run from another idle server within same network <br/>

            </h2>
            It looks like Zend team finally nailed it with newest revision of Zend Engine. Not only it's outperforming both Ruby and Python based solution it was only engine that
            passed 500 concurrent connections test without failing any.<br />
            <br />
            * I'm going to extend this test with NodeJS and do another approach to Ruby with Torque4 that from what I'm being told can be very fast.
